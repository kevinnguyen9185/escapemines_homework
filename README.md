# Escape Mines
A turtle must walk through a minefield. Write a program (console application) that will
read the initial game settings and one or more sequences of moves. For each move
sequence, the program will output whether the sequence leads to the success or failure
of the little turtle.
The program should also handle the scenarios where the turtle doesn’t reach the exit
point or doesn’t hit a mine.
